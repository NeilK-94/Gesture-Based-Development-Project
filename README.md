### About the project
This repository contains my submission for the Gesture Based UI Development Module. The repository contains a space shooter game made in Unity as well as a project write up and a README detailing the project specs and how to run it etc.

As this was a gesture based module there was a number of interesting pieces of hardware available to us to be implemented into our project. I chose to use the MYO armband, "The Myo armband lets you use the electrical activity in your muscles to wirelessly control your computer, phone, and other favourite digital technologies. With the wave of your hand, it will transform how you interact with your digital world". I also chose to add speech recognition to the game as I felt it could add to the games immersiveness.

I won't go into great detail on the gestures I used and why I chose them as this is all covered in the project write up included in this repository.

### Technologies used
The only piece of hardware I used for the is project was the Myo armband, technology wise I used visual studio 2017 as my text editor and Unity 2019 to develop the game.

#### Environment setup
In order to develop or update this game you would need the folowing:
- Myo Armband
- Myo SDK
- Unity 2019
- Myo plugin for Unity


### How to run
To run the game however, you just need to run the build provided in this readme. You would need to download and install Myo Connect for your preferred operating system as well as have a Myo armband also.
