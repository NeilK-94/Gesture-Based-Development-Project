# Gesture-Based-Development-Project
**Neil Kyne**

### About the project
This repository contains my submission for the Gesture Based UI Development Module. The repository contains a space shooter game made in Unity as well as a README detailing the project specs and how to run it etc.

As this was a gesture based module there was a number of interesting pieces of hardware available to us to be implemented into our project. I chose to use the MYO armband, "The Myo armband lets you use the electrical activity in your muscles to wirelessly control your computer, phone, and other favourite digital technologies. With the wave of your hand, it will transform how you interact with your digital world"

Mention controls with armband etc.
